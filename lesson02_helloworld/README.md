# 🌟 Lesson 2: Introduction to STM32

STM32 is a family of 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers developed by **STMicroelectronics**.  
They are widely used in industry, research, and projects because of their performance, low power consumption,  
and rich peripherals.  
Before proceeding to the first project, ensure you have downloaded the IDE.

Because of the diverse application needs, STM32 introduced different families ranging from low-power devices  
to high-performance systems.

| Series    | Core          | Focus                         | 
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **F0**    | Cortex-M0     | Entry-level MCU               |
| **F1**    | Cortex-M3     | General purpose, easy to use  |
| **F4**    | Cortex-M4     | Cost effective and efficient  |
| **L0/L4** | Cortex-M0+/M4 | Ultra-low power               |
| **H7**    | Cortex-M7     | High-end, very powerful       |

## ⚙️ Steps to Execute a Program in IDE

1) Write code in STM32CubeIDE.  
2) Compile into a binary/hex file.  
3) Flash the program into the microcontroller using ST-Link.  
4) We can run and debug code directly on the board.

## 👋 First Hello World Project

1) Start by launching STM32CubeIDE and create a workspace where you will keep the project.  
2) Then go to **New Project**, which will lead to the target selector page.  
3) Since we are using a standard board, go to **Board Selector** and select `STM32F4Discovery` (or whatever board you have).  
4) Click **Next**, give a project name (e.g., *helloworld*), and choose the project type.  
5) This will open your project folder. Here you will see the `inc` (header files) and `src` (source files) folders.  
6) After this, write the code in the `main.c` file and run it. To run, right-click on the project name and choose **Build Project**. This will run the code.  
7) There is also a debugger available to look for errors in the code.

## 💡 LED Blink Code

1) The STM32F407Discovery board consists of **4 LED pins**: PD12 (Green), PD13 (Orange), PD14 (Red), PD15 (Blue).  
2) For this LED blinking, you must choose the project type as **STM32Cube**, which gives access to peripherals.  
3) A new window called **CubeMX** will open, showing a graphical representation of the STM32. It lets us enable pins and peripherals.  
4) Set PD12 (Green) — or any LED pin — as **GPIO_Output**. After saving, the initialization code will be generated by the IDE.  
5) This opens your project folder where you will see `inc` and `src` folders. In the **Drivers** section, you will also see HAL libraries.  
6) Go to `main.c` and inside the `main` function, write the `while(1)` loop with the following code.
7) This will toggle the LED pin 12 with a delay of 500ms.After that build project and you will see the LED blinking!.

```c
while (1)
{
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12);
    HAL_Delay(500);
}
