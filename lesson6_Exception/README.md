## Exception Entry
1)Set the pending bit.  
2)Stacking and Vector fetch.  
3)Entry in handler mode and set active bit.  
4)Clears the pending status(processor does it automatically).  
5)Processor mode changed to handler mode.  
6)Hanlder code start executing.  
7)MSP used for any stack operations inside handler.

## Exit Sequence
1)In cortex processor the exception return mechanism is triggered using special return address called EXC_RETURN.  
2)EXC_RETURN generated during entry and stored in LR(Link Register).
3)When EXC_RETURN is written to PC it triggers the exception return.  
4)During exception handler entry,value of the return address is not stored in LR as it is done during calling C function.Instead exception mechanism stores 
special value called EXC_RETURN in LR.

## Decoding EXC_RETURN value
1)Bit 2 and 3 used as return stack and return mode respectively.  
For bit 3 thread mode will be represented as 1 and handler mode as 0.  
For bit 2 return will be done with PSP with 1 as bit value and 0 as return with MSP.  
2)What happens when exception triggers:-  
If 2nd bit is 0 unstacking will be done by MSP.MSP selected control[1]=0 and then resume program execution.  
If 2nd bit is 1 unstacking will be done by PSP.PSP selected control[1]=1 and then resume program execution.

## Fault Handlers
Fault exception generated by processor to indicate error.  
Reasons of fault:-  
1)Because of programmers handling processor by violating design rules or due to interfaces with which processor deals.  
2)When fault happens internel processor register will be updated to record type of fault,the address of instruction at which fault happened and if an
associated exception is enabled exception handler will be called by processor.  
3)In exception hanlder programmers may implement code to report,resolve or recover from fault.For example divide by 0.  
4)Reset,NMI,HardFault are such type of exceptions which are nonconfigurable.They are fixed in priority.  
5)Fault exceptions include hard fault,MemManage fault,BusFault,Usage Fault.  
6)Hard fault exceptions can be disabled using fault mask register.

## Real problems of fault
1)Divide by zero and undefined instructions.  
2)Attempt to execute code from memory region which is marked as execute never to prevent code injection.  
3)MPU guarded memory region access violation by code and unaligned data access.  
4)Returning to thread made keeping active interrupt alive and bus error.  
5)Executing SVC instruction inside SVC handler or calling function in SVC handler which eventually execute hidden SVC instruction.  
6)Debug monitor settings and related exceptions.

---

## Hard Fault Execption
Occurs because of an error during exception processing or exception not handled by other mechanism.  
Causes:-  
1)Escalation of configurable fault exceptions.  
2)Bus error returned during vector fetch.  
3)Execution of break point instruction when both halt mode and debug monitor is disabled.  
4)Executing SVC instruction inside SVC handler.  
5)When any configurable exceptions not enabled they are escalated to hardfault.
