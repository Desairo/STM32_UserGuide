# SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface)
1)SPI allows communication between one master and number of slaves.Slave can be EEPROM, Sensor, Display,etc.  
2)SPI uses 4 pins for communication which includes MISO(Matser-In Slave Out), MOSI(Master-Out Slave In), SCK(Serial Clock), 
SS(Slave Select).  
3)MISO used when we transmit in slave mode and recieve in master mode, MOSI works opposite to MISO, both of this are data pins.  
4)SCK is produced by master and goes to slave.If SCK not present no any communication happens.  
5)SS is used to select any one slave for communication.
