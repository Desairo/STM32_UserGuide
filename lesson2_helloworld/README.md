# Lesson 1: Introduction to STM32

STM32 is a family of 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers which is developed by STMicroelectronics.
They are widely used in industry, research, and even projects because of their performance, low power consumption, and rich peripherals.
Ensure you have downloaded the IDE before you proceed for first project.

Because of the diverse application needs STM32 introduced different families from low power devices to high 
performance system.

| Series    | Core          | Focus                         | 
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | 
| **F0**    | Cortex-M0     | Entry-level MCU               | 
| **F1**    | Cortex-M3     | General purpose,easy to use   | 
| **F4**    | Cortex-M4     | Cost effective and efficient  |
| **L0/L4** | Cortex-M0+/M4 | Ultra-low power               | 
| **H7**    | Cortex-M7     | High-end, very powerful       |

## Steps to execute program in IDE
1)Write code in STM32CubeIDE.  
2)Compile into a binary/hex file.  
3)Flash the program into the microcontroller using ST-Link.  
4)We can run and debug code directly on board.

## First Hello World Project
1)Start first by launching the STM32CubeIDE and then create a workspace where you will keep the project.  
2)Then go to new project as shown on the screen which will leads to target selector page.  
3)As we are using standard board go for board selector option at top and select the board STM32F4Discovery(whatever you have).  
4)Click next which will ask you to give project name.Name it helloworld and choose project type.    
5)This will open your project folder.Here you will see inc(used for header files) and src(source file) folders.  
6)After this write the code in main.c file and run it.To run it right click on project name and choose build project option.This will run the code.  
7)There is also debugger present to look for errors in code.

## LED blink Code
1)STM32F407Discovery board consist of 4 LED pins namely PD12(Green),PD13(Orange),PD14(Red),PD15(Blue).  
2)For this LED blinking you have to choose project type as STM32Cube which will give access to peripherals.
3)A new window will be opened which is CubeMx where we see a graphical represenattion of the STM32.It let us enable the pins and peripherals.  
4)Here we have to set PD12(Green) or any of the pin as GPIO_Output.After saving this the initialisation code will be generated by IDE.  
5)This will open your project folder.Here you will see inc and src folders.In Drivers section you will also see HAL libraries.  
6)Go to main.c file and in the main function write the while(1) loop and in that write the following code  
  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12);
  HAL_Delay(500);
7)This will toggle the LED pin 12 with a delay of 500ms.After that build project and you will see the LED blinking!.
